Removed unnecessary or irrelevant columns that did not contribute to analysis.

Standardized column names for clarity and uniformity.

Ensured consistent date formats across the dataset.

Verified the accuracy of disaster identifiers.

Prepared a clean and structured dataset suitable for further processing.

Ensured data reliability to avoid misleading insights in later stages.

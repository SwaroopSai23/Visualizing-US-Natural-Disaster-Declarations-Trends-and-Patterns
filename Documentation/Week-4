Week 4 – Live Dataset Importing & Dashboard Creation (Planned / Proposed)

A live dataset refers to data that is continuously updated from a real-world source rather than being static or fixed.

Live datasets reflect current and real-time changes, making analysis more practical and industry-oriented.

These datasets are usually sourced from APIs, cloud databases, government portals, or online data services.

In the context of analytics, a live dataset ensures that visualizations and insights update automatically when new data is added.

Live datasets help analysts work with real-world data challenges, such as missing values, changing formats, and large data volumes.

Unlike static datasets, live datasets require proper data refresh mechanisms.

Tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Python support live or scheduled data connections.

Using live datasets improves decision-making accuracy because insights are based on the latest data.

Live data is commonly used in business intelligence, disaster monitoring, finance, healthcare, and government analytics.

In our project, the US Natural Disaster dataset can be treated as a live dataset when connected directly to updated FEMA sources.

Live datasets allow dashboards to remain relevant and scalable over time.

Working with live data builds industry-ready data analytics skills.

It also helps understand data pipelines, refresh schedules, and performance optimization.

Live datasets support dynamic filtering and real-time analysis.

Overall, live datasets bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world analytics applications.

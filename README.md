📊 Visualizing US Natural Disaster Declarations

(FEMA Dataset – End-to-End Data Analytics Project)

1️⃣ Problem Statement

Natural disasters have increased in frequency and impact over the years, but understanding their trends, geographical spread, and incident patterns remains challenging.
This project analyzes FEMA’s disaster declaration data to uncover meaningful insights using data cleaning, EDA, and dashboard visualizations.
The goal is to support data-driven awareness and better disaster preparedness.

2️⃣ Dataset Description

Source: FEMA Web Disaster Declarations Dataset

Scope: United States (All states & territories)

Time Period: Multiple decades (historical data)

Key Attributes:

Disaster declaration date

State and region

Incident type (Flood, Hurricane, Fire, etc.)

Assistance programs declared

Duration and frequency of incidents

The dataset represents real-world live data, making it suitable for practical analytics and visualization use cases.

3️⃣ KPIs Used

The following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were used to measure trends and performance:

📈 Total Disaster Declarations per Year – Measures disaster frequency over time

🌍 State-wise Declaration Count – Identifies high-risk regions

🔥 Incident Type Frequency – Shows most common disaster types

🕒 Seasonality Trends – Monthly and yearly disaster patterns

🧭 Program Declaration Ratio – Measures assistance program usage

4️⃣ Dashboard Pages

The dashboard is divided into logical sections:

Overview Page

Total declarations

Year-wise trend analysis

High-level KPIs

Time Trend Analysis

Disaster declarations by year

Seasonal patterns (monthly trends)

Geographical Analysis

State-wise disaster distribution (map & bar charts)

Regional hotspots

Incident Type Analysis

Frequency of disaster types

Incident type vs state comparison

5️⃣ Key Insights

Disaster declarations have increased steadily over time, especially in recent decades

Floods and storms are the most frequently declared incidents

Coastal and western states show higher disaster concentration

Clear seasonal patterns exist for hurricanes and floods

Certain states consistently require federal assistance programs

6️⃣ Recommendations

Improve disaster preparedness in high-frequency states

Allocate resources seasonally based on historical trends

Strengthen early-warning systems for dominant incident types

Use predictive analytics for future disaster planning

Continuously update dashboards with live FEMA data

7️⃣ Tools Used

Python – Core data analysis

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and transformation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Static visualizations

Plotly – Interactive charts

Power BI – Dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis and documentation

GitHub – Version control and project hosting
